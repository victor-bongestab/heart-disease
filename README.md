# Heart Disease
The objective of this project is predicting patients with high risk of having a heart disease.

# How to run this model locally
I recommend pulling this repository as the model is already trained.
But if you want to, you can just download the jupyter notebook and run it. I made a dictionary with the fine tuned parameters.

P.S.: The images I uploaded are not going to show if you just download the jupyter notebook. But you can see them displayed in the code preview (https://github.com/victor-bongestab/heart-disease/blob/main/heart-disease.ipynb).
