# Heart Disease
The objective of this project is predicting patients with high risk of having a heart disease.

# How to run this model locally
I recommend pulling this repository as the model is already trained.
But if you want to, you can just download the jupyter notebook and run it. I made a dictionary with the fine tuned parameters.
